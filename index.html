      We made a game that simulates what an average
      highschool student with mental illness may go through.
    </br>
    <br>
      38% of female teens have an anxiety disorder.
    </br>
    <br>
      26.1% of male teens have an anxiety disorder.
    </br>
    <br>
      9.1% of teens have social anxiety disorder.
    </br>
    <br>
      Approximately 1 in 5 youth aged 13–18 (21.4%) experiences a severe mental disorder at some point during their life. For children aged 8–15, the estimate is 13%
    </br>
    <br>
      Just over half (50.6%) of children with a mental health condition aged 8-15 received mental health services in the previous year
    </br>
    <br>
      Half of all chronic mental illness begins by age 14; three-quarters by age 24. Despite effective treatment, there are long delays—sometimes decades—between the first appearance of symptoms and when people get help
    </br>
    <br>
      Over one-third (37%) of students with a mental health condition age 14­–21 and older who are served by special education drop out—the highest dropout rate of any disability group
    </br>
    <br>
      Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S., and the 2nd leading cause of death for people aged 10–34, more than 90% of people who die by suicide show symptoms of a mental health condition
    </br>
    <br>
      18 is Approximately common age to be diagnosted with anxiety
      Anxiety disorders are highly treatable, yet only 36.9% of those suffering receive treatment.
