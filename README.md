AÂ²ttack is a website with an API that finds mental health doctors near you. There is also a Scratch game we made, embedded into the
website. The main point of this project is to educate people and spread awareness, while also helping victims with links to 
donate to organization/show those people that they are not alone. We made this game for the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program as a final project and had lots of fun!
